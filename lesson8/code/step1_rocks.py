# LESSON 8 - STEP 1: ROCKS (and the problem they show)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Goal: put four big stone rocks in the Cube Hunt field, then fly right
# up beside one and watch its wall VANISH. That is the problem this
# lesson fixes.
#
# This starts from Lesson 7's finished game (step3_cube_hunt.py).
#
# What is new since Lesson 7:
#
#   1. ROCKS (lesson Part 1)
#        Four grey cubes, "size" 1.5, so each is 3 units wide. They sit
#        on the floor and do not spin. They are SCENERY: you can't
#        collect them.
#
#   2. "pickup": True / False (lesson Part 1)
#        Every thing gets a new key. Gold cubes are True, rocks are
#        False. Collecting and "nearest cube" only look at True ones.
#
#   3. New gold cubes never appear inside a rock (lesson Part 1)
#        new_pickup_spot() also says no to any spot closer than
#        ROCK_CLEARANCE (3) to a rock's centre.
#
# Nothing in the drawing has changed yet. Fly to (2.5, 0, 3), just right
# of the rock straight ahead, and look forward: the rock's whole side
# wall is skipped, because two of its corners are behind you
# (Lesson 4's rule: "any corner closer than NEAR? skip the face").
#
# Controls:  LEFT / RIGHT = turn,   UP / DOWN = look up / down
#            W / S = fly forward / back (the way you LOOK)
#            A / D = slide left / right,   Q / E = straight down / up
#            R = play again (after TIME UP)
#            G = floor grid on / off,   L = light on / off
# Run:  python step1_rocks.py
